# SAP IoT Rapid Connect - Business Network for Logistics - Global Track & Trace

## Use case

Global value chains are becoming increasingly complex due to rising geopolitical risk, trade growth, and volatility of material availability. Losses due to poor transportation conditions have become a multibillion-dollar problem due to extreme difficulty in identifying the cause of damage or when an incident occurred. These challenges offer a great opportunity to overhaul the overall value chain with a solution that can provide real-time information on transport operations – from changes in temperature and humidity to whether the goods have been tilted – to all parties involved, giving everyone the ability to quickly adapt to potential incidents and rapidly recover from them.
